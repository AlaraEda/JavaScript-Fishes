# Killing all the colorful Fishes
Look. You don't understand;
```
I'm not murderous... 
      I actually adore little fishes...

                  .
                  .
                  .    
 ```

_**But I just had to kill them all.**_

### OPDRACHT
I have made this little exercise to better understand Javascript, CSS and HTML.
<br>The goal of the game is just clicking on as many fish as you can.
